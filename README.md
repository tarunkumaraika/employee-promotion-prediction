# 🧠 Employee Promotion Prediction

This project focuses on predicting **employee promotions** using various **Machine Learning algorithms** on an **unbalanced dataset**. The goal is to help organizations identify which employees are most likely to get promoted, based on their performance, experience, and other factors.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

In many companies, the promotion process is manual and biased. This project leverages **supervised machine learning models** to predict employee promotions automatically, especially when dealing with **imbalanced data distributions**.

The dataset used is highly unbalanced, meaning the number of promoted employees is significantly lower than those not promoted.  
To tackle this issue, **sampling techniques** and **algorithmic adjustments** were applied to achieve better prediction performance.

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used

- **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** ⚙️  
- **Logistic Regression** 📉  

Each model was trained, evaluated, and compared to determine the best-performing approach.
